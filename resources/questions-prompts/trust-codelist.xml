                <scripture>With this in mind, since I myself have carefully investigated everything from the beginning, I too decided to write an orderly account for you, most excellent Theophilus, so that you may know the certainty of the things you have been taught".</scripture>
                <narrative>We trust historical account for two reasons 1) how near to the event they were written 2) how many copies survive. There are less than 10 surviving copies of Plato's writing, the earliest of which is 1400 years older than Plato. The New Testament was written within 30 -50 years of Jesus' death and there are 24,000+ copies.</narrative>
